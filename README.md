This is an educational project developing by Maxim Ivanov (Aarenoksitolikus) from Akvelon.

This is simple example of bank application which main idea is to train my skills in multithreading, collections and some other things

This is MVC project without any DB connections (all data collected at common Java collections)

For all questions and comments please contact to me by Skype (Maxim Ivanov), my own email (super.maxa2001@yamdex.ru) or Telegram (@Aarenoksitolikus)
